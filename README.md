# LoRa range tester
LoRA range testing stack based on Rpi

# Description
In order to perform range tests there is a requirement to record the geographical position of the node's location at the time the transmission is made to the gateway. To meet these needs and taking advantage of modern technologies in our field of study, we have compiled an array of devices to create an application for easy and effective mass range measurements. The array comprises two (n) nodes, one Rpi3 and one Tablet.
Rpi3 is used as an application server, as an iot server and at the same time as a web server. It creates a wifihotspot to which a device can be connected to a GPS and access the application with a browser. From there the user can at any time depending on the location which is to make a "PING" of the serially connected LORA node devices to the gateway.
